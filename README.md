# Udacity-Neighborhood-map-project
This app is to demonstrate the ability to use a JavaScript framework (`knockout.js`) & Google Maps API.
The application was made as a the penultimate final project for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree.

## Code
CSS - Two files make up the CSS files that are local. Bootstrap CSS 
- `mStyle.css` (custom)

JS - There are quite a few here and I will try explain as best as possible without becoming too convoluted.
- `knockout-3.4.2.js` (KnockoutJS framework)
- `app.js` (Main application JS file)
- `styles.js` (Contains the styles for the custom Google Maps look)
- `scores.js` (Contains locations to populate the map)

HTML - `Index.html` is where all the magic happens and all the data is binded.

## Features
A Google Maps implemenation that shows you the best places in Ramallah City in Paletine including Hotels , Cafe , Medical .. and more

## APIs
Google Maps API is used here to show the map and generate the markers.
Foursquare API is used to pull more information on my favorite locations 

## Installation
Clone or download this repo and simply open the index.html file and enjoy!
